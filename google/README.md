# Google Services API Integration

This project demonstrates how to interact with various Google services using Python. It includes examples for Google
Drive, Google Contacts, and Google Sheets.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x installed
- Google API credentials (JSON file) for the respective services
- Required Python packages installed (see `requirements.txt`)

## Running the script

The main script can be executed via command line using the following instructions:

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file.

2. Run the command:

```bash
python main.py [command]
```

Replace `[command]` with one of the following commands depending on the operation you want to perform:

- `save_contacts`: This command saves the contacts to a Google Sheet.
- `other_command`: The functionality for this command should be added accordingly.

If an unknown command is entered, the script will notify the user about the unknown command.

Note: Ensure that you have the necessary permissions and credentials to perform these operations.
